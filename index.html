      <h1>WELCOME</h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to our financial management and independence website!
        <br>
        <br>
        We are a group of young Australians who understand the difficulties and frustrations that come alongside the journey towards financial management in today’s economic environment, as well as the necessity of and freedoms that come with financial independence.
        <br>
        We have created this website with the intention of helping other young Australians to understand and manage their financial situations, and enable them in working towards financial independence.
        <br>
        <br>
        On this website you can find a number of tools to aid in the journey of financial independence.
        <br>
        These tools include: a financial calculator; some general financial tips and tricks; a COVID help page; and a contact us page, should you require further help or information.
        <br>
        <br>
        Our financial Calculator has been designed to use a percentage based algorithm that will divide your weekly income into 4 categories, and provide personalised easy to understand information to help you understand your current financial position, and work towards financial independence in a stress free way.
        <br>
        <br>
        Our COVID Help page has been created with some additional tips and helpful information that may be considered to aid in staying on top of finances during lockdowns and amidst the current pandemic.
        <br>
        <br>
        We have also included a page of tips and tricks that are important and helpful when it comes to managing money.
        <br>
        <br>
        We believe the tools we have provided are an integral part of financial management, and we hope you’re able to utilise the tools and tips we have provided on this website to help you on your road to financial independence!
