<h1>Tips and Tricks</h1>

<h2>Use our financial calculator</h2>
<p>Our financial calculator allows you to input your weekly income. Once you've done this our calculator will then automatically split your income into 4 different categories based on percentages for the best stratergy for you. The 4 categories are split into Spending, Expenses, Savings, and Investments. Based on this information the calculator will then provide specific information to assist you. By providing this information in an easily digestible format we hope to make financial management easy and stress free. You can then use this information and combine it with the tips below to further improve your finicancial situation.</p>

<h2>Track your spending</h2>
<p>The first step to track your spending is to see how much money is exiting your accounts. For two weeks track everything that is leaving through your accounts. Make sure you include EVERY transaction whoever smal it may be. Your bank may already have this produced for you or many banks requrie you to request your spending. This may be challenging and boring for the one or two weeks but will ensure you're on your way to saving in no time.It will give you a clear view of where your money is going and highlight any clear problems you may have.</p>


<h2>Seperate utlities from wants</h2>
<p>Use the information we have collected for you based on you lockdowns and the savings you may have decided to track and seperate those that are your 'wants' and those that are the essential utilities that you 'need' to stay, e.g. gas, energy, internet and rent. Once you have done this start cutting down on your wants. You can also look for cheaper alternatives for your current utilities</p>

<h2>Create a budget that suits you</h2>
<p>Using the tools on our website you can combine this with your tracked spendings to start budgeting. Budgeting is esssential when trying to get a hold of your finances, the important part of this step is creating a budget that suits YOU. Not all budgets will fit your lifestyle.</p>

<h2>Create/Deposit into a savings account</h2>
<p>If you want to go on a holiday or want to make an expensive purchase at one time savings accounts can be great. Savings accounts usually have restricted access that will only let you deposit into the account, this means you're forced to save for a certain period of time. These accounts also have higher interest rates than basic accounts, to make the most of a savings account you should deposit a set weekly amount and watch it accrue over time. These accounts are also extremely easy to open making them a great tool for everyone.</p>


<h2>Protecting yourself from scams</h2>
<p>What's even worse then spending money is losing money, make sure you watch out for scams that may try to take advantage of coronavirus. Scams can take any form. Be wary of any unsolicated offers/deals you may recieve that are too good to be true.</p>
